Wikipoet
========

Wikipoet is a program written by [Ross Goodwin](http://rossgoodwin.com) that writes simple poems, using Wikipedia to find words that could describe (or could be described by) an input word. The Python modules NLTK and Requests are required to run the program, and your computer must be connected to the internet.

WHen prompted, enter any word, and Wikipoet will start. Generating a complete poem takes approximately 30 minutes, but could take longer if you have a slow internet connection.
